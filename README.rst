LaTeX wrappers
==============

Allows calling LaTeX from Python script without leaving a mess. Similar to the
(officially obsolete) `tex <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tex/>`_ package, whose
successor is not PyPi-installable.

Also comes with support for using `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ templates
to generate LaTeX files.
